    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Ruffalo Noel Levitz Data Visualization Project</h3>
    <p>One recent project I have completed was a project for Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a academic institution consulting company based out of Cedar Rapids.
        Ruffalo Noel Levitz conducts surveys for universitys, colleges and organizations and prepares results in the form of Power BI dashboards for the clients to
        gain an understanding of how their unversity is performing according to their students. Recently me and a team of collegues at the University of Iowa were tasked
        with updating the Power BI dashboards for RNL, so their clients could gather more insights and have a more overall useful and usable dashboard containing their results.
        Below are two examples of the dashboards we developed to further insights for RNL clients.

    <h3>Data Mining NFL Score Prediction Project</h3>
    <p>Another recent project I have completed was a data mining project where me and two teammates developed a model using R and Rattle
        to predict the score of NFL games based on historic data from NFL games. We wanted to be able to predict the score of an NFL game
        based off the historic data and the sports betting lines to get an educated prediction of whether a game would be "over" or "under"
        the set line of total points by sportsbooks. We were able to develop a model with an MAE or mean average error of 6. This project
        allowed us to predict total points in games with relatively high accuracy and also gave us a chance to put our data mining skills at work
        with a real world example. Below is a slide from our presentation outlining how our model operates.
