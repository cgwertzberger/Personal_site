    <h2>About Chase</h2>
    <p> Hello! I currently am a Senior in the Tippie College of Business at The University of Iowa. I am majoring in Business Analytics & Information Systems and Management with a minor in Sports
        Recreation and Management. I am currently a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity here at Iowa and have served as our Academic Chairman and Standards Chairman over the past year.
        During my time at Iowa, I have had the opportunity to develop my analytical, leadership, and other business skills to best prepare myself for my future career.
        In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and my girlfriend (Caitlin). I really enjoy watching tv, movies, and sporting events, as well as exploring Iowa City and cheering on the Hawkeyes.
    </p>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>I will graduate from the University of Iowa in May of 2022. After graduation from the University I will be moving to Des Moines, IA to begin my career as a Merchandising Analyst at Kum & Go.
        As a Merchandising Analyst, I will be tasked with helping Kum & Go effectively price their products, and also input data to ensure every product is ringing in properly.
        In this role with Kum & Go, I hope to continue to develop my professional and analytical skills and advance my career.  I am very excited to be joining such a well-established
        organization and I look forward to what the future holds.
